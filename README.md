# ECE_284_Neighbor_Joining

Running the code using the command:

    g++ neighbor_join.cpp -o a.exe; ./a.exe

Following this, I am running Graphviz using the below command

    dot -Tpng g.gv -o file.png

This will generate a png file called file.png which can be viewed with any image viewer. 

Note: Will need to download Graphviz. It can be downloaded from https://graphviz.org/download/
